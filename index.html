                    <p>Hello! My name is Spencer Keith, and I am a (super) senior student at the University of Wisconsin - Eau Claire. My major is Computer Science Comprehensive. I am also an intern at the ResCom Help Desk on campus, a nine-semester member of the Singing Statesmen choir, and the Business Manager of <em>The Innocent Men</em> a cappella group.</p>
                    <p>Though Computer Science is my major, it is also one of my passions. After two major changes, I found a home in CS and have fallen in love with the field. I love software engineering, but also have string interest in cybersecurity, web development, machine learning, and other areas of the field. I know many different programming languages, including Python, HTML/CSS/JS, SQL, and C, but consider my favorite language to be C++, and my <em>best</em> language to be Java.</p>
                    <p>As my aforementioned roles in unversity music groups might suggest, I am also incredibly passionate about music! I love to write, produce, and release original music (even if I usually end up hating it due to my perfectionism). I also create arrangements for the aforementioned <em>Innocent Men</em>. This semester (my last semester in the group before graduation), we are holding a ballads concert which features three arrangements from me: "Fix You" by Coldplay, "Break My Heart Again" by FINNEAS, and my solo song, "Karma Police" by Radiohead.</p>
                    <p>My goals for the future are to graduate, to move back to Minnesota with my partner, to obtain a position that I love and can grow within, and to (eventually) purchase a house and start a family. I would be happy with a position in most any subset of the Computer Science field, but would have especial interest in software engineering, cybersecurity, or web development.</p>
